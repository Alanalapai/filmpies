        <section>
          <p> 
            
            In recent years, the increasing production and popularity of superhero movies have made it one of the dominating genres, but such phenomenon has also ensued where visuals, sound effects and action scenes tend to overshadow the spirit of story, such as the depth of character. For superhero movies, nothing is more important than the depth of the characters. If the characters lack dimension, it fails to be a good superhero movie because characters, as the center of the plot, are what enliven the whole story. This concept, though important, is what many superhero stories’ movie adaptation fail to do well, and it reminds me of the Marvel comic character Hulk, whose story has its two movie adaptations in the early 2000s, which are <em>Hulk</em> (2003) and <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (2008). These two films are good examples of how a comic-based story featuring the same character could vary after becoming superhero movies. <br><br>
            Before delving into my opinions on the two films, let me introduce this comic character briefly: <br><br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Overwhelmed by his tensions and fury, Dr. Bruce Banner turns into a green-skinned humanoid many times his original size, which is known as the Hulk. He’s in anguish since he doesn’t seek or desire this power of the vast degree of physical strength. This devastating power pits Bruce against the military of the country, and causes him a lot of troubles not only because his life is threatened, but because of his relationship with Betty, his girlfriend, whose father is the commander of military office. As the whole world spares no efforts in capturing and killing the Hulk (Bruce), Betty is the only one who shows sympathy and caring for Bruce. In the end, driven by the struggle between human and monster and struck by frustration, Bruce leaves his country and hides himself away.<br><br>
          </p>
          <p>
            The two films, <em>Hulk</em> (2003) and <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (2008), though both including the elements in the comic mentioned above, make some of their own adjustment to the story and give different developments of the character Hulk. Hence, that’s when it sparked debates over which adaptation is better. <em>Hulk</em> (2003) received lots of criticisms, while <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (2008) was widely considered a better version. <em>Hulk</em> (2003), directed by Ang Lee, was regarded as being too atypical for the superhero genre; most people don’t enjoy it due to the slow pace, lengthiness (more than 2 hours, which is very long for this kind of genre), mediocre special effects, and the lacking in the promptness of action scenes, which do not appear until 40 minutes into the film.<br><br>
            Although <em>Hulk</em> (2003) is widely less favored due to the above reasons, I prefer it and considered it better than <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (2008) given the following reasons: It shows a lot more character depth based on Hulk’s stronger background story as human Bruce, and a better interaction between Bruce and his girlfriend Betty. In addition, the depth of the character Hulk makes the film’s action scenes more powerful. <br><br>
          </p>          
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Character depth — the background story of Hulk</h2><br>
          <p>
            The main reason I think <em>Hulk</em> (2003) is better than <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (2008) is the character depth, and this can be seen in two parts: the protagonist Hulk’s background story as his alter-ego Bruce and his heartfelt interaction with his girlfriend Betty. <br><br>
            First, I want to talk about its stronger background story of Hulk. Ang Lee’s <em>Hulk</em> (2003) delves into the origin of this humanoid, in which the Hulk genes had been passed along from Bruce’s father, who illegally experimented Hulk genes on his own DNA to Bruce, and the “hulkhood” in Bruce was released many years later after a lab accident in which he was exposed to massive gamma radiation. <br><br>
            Not only does the movie illustrate the reason for the transformation, but it also explores the tragic childhood event that is repressed in Bruce’s memory where he witnessed his father killing his mom. This adds dimension to his alter-ego Hulk, since it combines the rage that turns Bruce into the monster with his childhood trauma. The fierceness of the Hulk thus acquires a human, sentimental layer of meaning: the thing Hulk suffers from (the unusual power he doesn’t seek or desire) comes from his own family, more specifically his own father. Moreover, those childhood memories are shown repeatedly in flashbacks throughout the film, emphasizing the duality of the character Hulk, who is not only a destructive monster, but also the mild, emotionally reserved Dr. Bruce who has such miserable genes. In this way, we see more human elements in the monster Hulk, thus allowing us to have an integral understanding of the character and stirs up our sympathy.

          <p>
            In contrast, in <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (2008), the reason for Bruce’s ability to turn into Hulk is only briefly mentioned (within 3 minutes) in the opening which features quick shots of the lab accident responsible for the transformation. After the lab accident, Bruce escaped to Brazil to study breath control with a master, which curbed his tension that could turn him into Hulk. Thus, the background of this version of Hulk becomes rather simple and weak―a scientist seeking cure for the annoying Hulk power after a lab accident. What’s worse, in this version, the triggering factor for Bruce’s transformation is changed into “the speeding up of heart rate”. <br><br>
            In other words, the reason for the transformation is simplified into only numbers (that show his heart rate), which narrows the depth of the character in that he can turn into the Hulk even when he’s not in rage but overcome with excitement whenever the heartbeat picks up. That is to say, the number instead becomes more decisive than emotion. Compared with Hulk’s childhood tragedy depicted in <em>Hulk</em> (2003), the newer version of Hulk comes across as being rather one-dimensional. Numbers (the heart rate) serve as merely a tool of plot, a cheap and easy way to illustrate Bruce’s transformation, yet overshadowing the importance of establishing the character’s depth of emotion, of rage and hopelessness in the unforgiving world. Therefore, the Hulk in <em>Hulk</em> (2003) is much more appealing because its strong background story makes it more intriguing and emotionally powerful. <br>

          <h2>Character depth — the interaction between Bruce and his girlfriend Betty</h2>
          <p>
            The second point of character depth that makes me consider <em>Hulk</em> (2003) a better version is its better interaction between Bruce and her girlfriend Betty. It does a better job at portraying the relationship between the two since it features quite a few scenes where the couple have deep conversations and heartfelt interactions. For instance, after the second transformation during which Betty first witnessed Hulk’s appearance and power, she asked Bruce (then already transformed back to human) what he remembered when he was the Hulk. That’s when Bruce said that he couldn’t remember anything but only feelings of rage, power, and freedom. “You know what scares me the most? When it happens, when it comes over me... and I totally lose control, I like it.” Bruce revealed his mentality. Betty went on presuming that the repressed memory of Bruce’s traumatic childhood event could accelerate his transformation and this worried her a lot. This scene not only shows that Betty is trying to understand Bruce (after knowing that his boyfriend could turn into a monster) through a heart-to-heart conversation, but also echoes the idea previously mentioned that Hulk’s fierceness is combined with his trauma. <br>

          <p>
             In another scene in <em>Hulk</em> (2003), Hulk escaped from the military prison situated in a desert, and headed towards the city to find Betty. On his way to the city, he was chased and bombarded by plenty of helicopters, during which he remained furious and destroyed a couple of helicopters. When he finally made it to the city, the area was packed with full armed soldiers, tanks and helicopters that surrounded him, ready to kill him. Thankfully, Betty showed up on a close building which Hulk was looking at, and walked down from the stairs to come to him. No one could shoot since it could harm Betty, who is the officer’s daughter. While Hulk was watching his lover approaching him, he gradually shrank back to human. She gave Bruce a long, tight hug as she comforted him and said “It’s okay. I’m here”, while the surrounding armed soldiers were coming closer to them. Then the moment came, the close-up shot of Betty: After seeing those soldiers, she cried hopelessly, closed her eyes, and held Bruce tighter. This scene is so emotionally powerful because it shows Betty is the only one in the world who supports and comforts him in this unforgiving world. This version vividly manifests how intertwined the relationship is, and the character depth also shines through.

          <p>
            However, in contrast, the interaction between the couple in <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (2008) comes across as rather shallow. For instance, while Bruce was secretly living with Betty at night in her apartment, they talked about trivial matters like, “I should help you buy some new cloth”, “hi”, “I feel a lot better”, and “Are you kidding me? Thank you”. Very few matters concerning their deep emotions and Bruce’s struggles between monster and human are included in the conversation. Although the scriptwriter wants to present the relationship between the two as casual and just like a normal couple, it loses the certain kind of tension and sorrow which the transformation can entail in a relationship. Thus, <em>Hulk</em> (2003) gives the deeper character depiction due to its telling interactions in the relationship.

          <h2>Action scenes — based on character depth</h2>
          <p>
            Last but not least, when it comes to a superhero movie, action scenes are a must since that’s mostly where the thrill comes from. However, when they are overused or too showy, it could lead to a fatigue that makes the fights and special effects dull and less interesting. This flaw is what <em>Hulk</em> (2003) succeeds in avoiding but what <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (2008) fails. The main reason for this consists in the depth of the stories which the former is rich in but the latter lacks.<br><br>
          </p>
          <h3>The First Action Scene</h3>
          <p>
             For <em>Hulk</em> (2003), although many people think that the first action scene comes too slowly, where Bruce first transforms into Hulk and destroy things in the building, appearing after 40 minutes into the film, I contend that it’s a smart move. The fact that it takes so long to show action scenes actually indicates director Ang Lee’s thoughtfulness for the brewing and development of the characters, rather than sloppily cutting into mindless special effects and action scenes. This move makes the appearance of the first action scene powerful and meaningful since before that, enough background story for Bruce has already been told: the origin of the Hulk gene created by his father before he was born, the childhood tragedy partially told (and would come in flashback in later scenes), and the lab accident that would give rise to his transformation. We thus can understand his driving force to unleash his anger. <br><br>
             By contrast, in <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (2008), much to most people’s expectation for promptness, the first action scene appears in the first 20 minutes, and before it comes only with Bruce in Brazil controlling his breath and heartbeat, some shots showing us the life in Brazil, and the American military finding out the whereabouts of Bruce, without much information about what leads to the becoming of Hulk. Although the first action scene where Hulk crashes the soldiers and roared is explosive and more action-packed, it’s still more of an “action-only” scene, like a tool to pop up action merely to grab people’s attention but without showing anything vital to the story. <br><br>
          </p>
          <h3>The Final Action Scene</h3>
          <p>
             Likewise, the final battle scene, which is the climax of each version also shows the kind of difference mentioned previously. In <em>Hulk</em> (2003), this scene that features Bruce wrestling with his father, and chasing each other in the sky and by the lake, is phenomenal as every punch and roar is threaded with emotions, with the complicated parent-child sentiments. <br><br>
          </p>
          <img src="../imgs/Hulk/fatherson2003.jpg"/>
          <span>Bruce and his father — <em>Hulk</em> (2003) </span>
          <p>
             By contrast, <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (2008)’s final action scene that features the battle between Hulk and Abomination (a monster transforming from a vicious soldier named Blonsky) is very cookie-cutter. Their alter-egos, Bruce and Blonsky, are opponents to each other merely because they are all huge-sized monsters, with Hulk being the only one who can stop Abomination from ravaging the city. This setting turns the scene into a video-game like battle instead of a battle with depth of background and meanings. Although this version of the final action scene is longer and more action-packed, it could only reach so far. <br>
             Action scenes can easily draw attention, but when it lacks depth and instead focuses too solely on the fighting, it becomes dull and meaningless. That’s not what a good storytelling should be.   
          </p>
          <img src="../imgs/Hulk/hulk_vs_abomination.jpg"/>
          <span>The battle between Hulk and Abomination — <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (2008)</span>
          <p>
            To sum up, <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (2008) comes with more flashy visual effects and actions, but at the end its character Hulk lacks depth. On the other hand, although <em>Hulk</em> (2003) is not a typical superhero movie, with many of its traits being considered drawbacks, it really focuses a lot on developing the character Hulk, which enlivens the whole story. For me, it shows more respect for the main character of the story, instead of showing off special effects and action scenes. This care for the character, which is the one so many superhero movies nowadays fail to present, is enough to offset <em>Hulk</em> (2003)’s weak points, and for me to consider <em>Hulk</em> (2003) better than <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (2008).
