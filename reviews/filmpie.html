                      <em>Filmpie</em> is a review site for movies and TV/streaming shows.
                        If you’re looking for objective and plain summaries for stories, then this isn’t a place for you. However, if you are willing to take a look at some films from a different perspective, with thoughts that you might not have come across, then <em>Filmpie</em> is for you. As a movie buff, I enjoy sharing with people thoughts on films that I love and those I have opinions about, and <em>Filmpie</em> is a platform to take what I enjoy to a more global, readily accessible level. Categorically, reviews include movies, TV/streaming (films released on online streaming platforms like Netflix), and memes. The “meme” section provides thoughts that I consider funny yet thought-provoking, and I believe they're more straightforward and approachable through the delivery of memes. 
                        <br><br>

                        My reviews are mainly for those who have already watched the films/shows, so SPOILDERS ALERT! Yet still, if you simply want to understand a film or are seeking a reason to watch it, <em>Filmpie</em> is always here for you.
